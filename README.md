#Tic Tac Toe Project


#Description
I created an in-browser tic tac toe game where users will be able to sign up,
sign in, and play against a friend (locally).

#Technologies Used:
Languages:
-HTML 5
-CSS
-JavaScript
Libraries:
-Bootstrap
-jQuery
API:
-General Assembly's Game Project API

#Strategies:
-My plan was to follow the proposed schedule.
-I started with the html based on my wireframe. I tried to keep it simple so I
could use my time to focus on the game logic and game API. However, I also wanted
to have a thought out structure that would make it easier for me to style and visualize
the final design.
-With the html I spent some time on the game board, knowing that if I planned for
it in the beginning, I would have an easier time integrating it with the JavaScript
board and gathering data for the game API. Which is why I chose to use the html data
attribute.
-I spent longer than I anticipated on the game logic which left me less time for
styling this time around.
-Again I focused some time on what data I would need to be able to access for the
game API while creating the game logic.
-I added the API features, starting with the user authentication and then the game
data.

Overall, my strategies helped, but everything took longer than I thought it would.
I had hoped to do a lot more styling and adding of features. However, I had lots
of little bugs pop up that took precedence.

#Unsolved Problems/ Future Features:
-I had some issues with the game logic once I started implementing the game API
features. I would like to refactor my code and make it cleaner and easier to follow.
-My first goal would to make it responsive. I had tried to make it responsive from
the beginning but didn't get the time to keep it up.
-I would like to make some changes to the styling, fonts, themes, and add images
to replace the X's and O's.
-I would like to display game data for the user.
-I would eventually like to implement the online multiplayer functionality.
